## Didn't work?

Aren't you able to complete the previous steps successfully? If you're using a Mac it is possible that you need to start RVM and the latest Ruby version for your user and try again. Mac OS X comes with a preinstalled ruby version that can be problematic for Jekyll (then you can do `brew install ruby`, if you don't want to manage your ruby versions with RVM).

## Mediasmart Mobile, S.L. - Privacy Policy


At Mediasmart, we take fundamental rights of end users (data subjects) seriously and we are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and your privacy rights.

This document explains when and why we collect personal information about people who are exposed to the advertisements (“Ads”) in which technical serving process we are involved, how we use such personal information, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we intend to keep it secure.

This Policy might evolve from time to time so please check this page occasionally to ensure that you’re up to date with any changes.
Any questions regarding this Policy and our privacy practices should be sent by email to legal@mediasmart.io

### Who we are

We are Mediasmart Mobile, S.L. a software as a service platform for advertisers, agencies and companies seeking to dramatically improve their on-line advertising strategies. We are a Spanish limited liability company, with tax ID number B-86329638 and our registered address on: Calle Garcia de Paredes 12, 1ºB, 28010, Madrid.

### How do we collect information from you?

We process very limited information about you (your “Personal Information”), on behalf of our clients when you use any of our providers products or services which use Ads within them. What this means is that when you for instance use an App or visit a web page from a mobile device that shows Ads, chances are that such advertisement impressions have been “purchased” by companies using our software as a service platform in order to serve you such Ads.

### What type of information is collected from you?

The Personal Information we collect on behalf of our clients includes on-line identifiers from the mobile device used to run the App or browse the web pages in which the Ad impression was served and might include as well the IP address being used at the time the Ad was served and other ancillary information such as: the size of the ad space, the operating system and version running in your mobile device, the category of the app or website where it was served, or the approximate location of the device.

Please note that while these identifiers are regarded as Personal Information and we process and protect them as such, they do not specifically nor automatically identify you as an individual. While it would be extremely difficult for us or for any third Party to know about your specific identity using this information, at any time you might choose to reset the on-line identifier of your mobile devices rendering all and any personal data linked to such devices obsolete.

### How is your information used?

We use your information to:

- Allow our customers to target their advertisement campaigns, for example, the product an advertiser is promoting may work only in a given country and a certain operating system, and in order to properly manage the campaign our system needs to read the IP address (to understand in which country the Ad will be served in) and the operating system;
- Allow our customers to generate user segments (what we call “audiences”) based your previous interactions with their advertising campaigns;
- Allow our customers to target identifiers based on them being part of certain user segments (those segments may have been created with our platform or a different one);
- Allow our customers to track whether or not you have engaged with their ads

Allowing our customers to target user segments is what we call “Interest Based Advertising”.

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity (we have set a general maximum limit of six (6) months).

### Who has access to your information?

We may need to share your information with certain partners at the very moment our system has to decide whether or not to buy some specific ad space as programmed or instructed by our clients. For example, if the App or website where you are about to see an ad does not tell us which country you are in, we will need to send your IP address to one of our partners to find out about the country based on your IP address (all of our campaigns have to be targeted to one or several specific countries). Or, if our client is working with a Data Provider, and targets a campaign to user segments created by that Data Provider, we will need to check with said Data Provider whether your identifier is in the targeted user segment before we decide to try and buy the Ad slot.

Our clients will have access to your information when they have purchased that impression and thus have served you an Ad.

### Third Party Service Providers working on our behalf:
- AdSquare ([adsquare.com](http://www.adsquare.com)), a mobile data exchange who can work as a
Data Provider for our customers

However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the Personal Information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have a contract in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for any other purposes. Please be reassured that we will not release your information to third parties beyond the Ads serving process we’ve described, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.

### You may opt-out of this interest based advertising process altogether

 **Please note that you have the choice to opt-out from all Interest Based Advertising activities by changing the settings on your Android or iOS phone or tablet (we never use your identifiers if you use mobile devices with any other operating system).**

Your iOS or Android mobile device provides a “Limit Ad Tracking” or “Opt out of interest-based advertising” setting. When you have opted out using this setting on a device, we will not allow our clients to use personal information collected from that device for any targeting purposes, nor to create any user segments.

You can find the setting for your mobile device by following the directions below:

**iOS Device iOS 7 or Higher**: Go to your Settings > Select Privacy > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting iOS 6 Go to your Settings >Select General > Select About > Select Advertising > Enable the “Limit Ads Tracking” setting.

**For Android devices with OS 2.2 and up and Google Play Services version 4.0 and up**: Open your Google Settings app > Ads > Enable “Opt out of interest-based advertising” If you’ve turned on Limit Ad Tracking on your iOS device or the Opt out of interest-based ads on your Android device, you can restore interest-based ads by turning the settings off.

When you opt out, you may still see the same number of Ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they won’t be based on your interests, neither Ads bought with our platform, nor with any other platform. We may continue to serve you Ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the application you are using.


### How you can access and update your information

You can opt-out of interest based advertising coming ONLY from our clients by providing us your advertising identifier (IDFA if you have an iPhone or GAID if you have an Android phone).

By providing us with these identifiers, we can also tell you what user segments in our system your identifiers are currently part of. You may request us to be deleted from certain user segments and we shall communicate your request to the corresponding client.

### Security precautions in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information

We take this matter seriously and we’re continuously evolving our platform to make sure data integrity and data security are always a priority. Our platform and servers use encryption techniques for storage and transmission of data.

### Profiling

Our clients may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that Ads can be better targeted to you. We may also use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud.

## Who we are

We are Mediasmart Mobile, S.L. ("Mediasmart") a software as a service platform for advertisers, agencies and companies seeking to dramatically improve their on-line advertising strategies. We are a Spanish limited liability company, with tax ID number B-86329638 and our registered address on: Calle Garcia de Paredes 12, 1ºB, 28010, Madrid. 

## How do we collect information from you?

We process very limited information about you (your "Personal Information").

Such Personal Information is collected in the following ways:

- **On our website and servers**, when you visit and browse through it and/or use any of the services we provide through it such as accessing "**bsmart**") our advertising biding platform.
- **On behalf of our clients**: We collect Personal Information when you use any of our providers products or services which use Ads within them. What this means is that when you for instance use an App or visit a web page from a mobile device that shows Ads, chances are that such advertisement impressions have been "purchased" by companies using our software as a service platform in order to serve you such Ads. Our advertisement serving software collects Personal Information to the extent and in the way explained in this policy (please see next section).


## What type of information is collected from you?

The Personal Information we collect through our website/servers and/or on behalf of our clients include cookies and on-line identifiers from the mobile device used to run the App or browse the web pages in which the Ad impression was served and might include as well the IP address being used at the time the Ad was served and other ancillary information such as: the size of the ad space, the operating system and version running in your mobile device, the category of the app or website where it was served, or the approximate location of the device.

'Cookies' are small text files containing pieces of information (often including a unique identifier), sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive to allow a website to recognise you each time you visit. They collect statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns and do not generally identify you as an individual.
Mobile devices identifiers have been likened to cookies.

Please note that while these cookies and device identifiers are regarded as Personal Information and while we process and protect them as such, they do not specifically and automatically identify you as an individual. While it would be extremely difficult for us or for any third Party to know about your specific identity using this information, at any time you might choose to: erase or remove your browser cookies as well as reset the on-line identifier of your mobile devices rendering all and any personal data linked to such devices obsolete.

## Which is the legal basis for this processing of your Personal Information

We rely on the following separate bases to lawfully process your information:

i. Usage of the bsmart platform: We need to process your Personal Information in order to be able to provide you to access to the bsmart in accordance with its Terms of Service. This processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us.
ii. We may process Personal Information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests.

## How is your Personal Information used?

Website and server cookies ared used internally to measure how the different sections from our website work, track your browsing through it and also in order to find out where is the traffic coming from at any moment in time.

Bsmart cookies are used to identify you within the platform and in order to provide you with our Services, including information about how you interact with the platform and those of our third-party partners and information that allows us to recognise and associate your activity across devices and Services. This information may include information such as IP address, cookie information, browser version, operating system type and version, mobile network information, device settings and software data.

With regard to device identifiers collected on behalf of our customers, we use them to:

allow our customers to target their advertisement campaigns, for example, the product an advertiser is promoting may work only in a given country and a certain operating system, and in order to properly manage the campaign our system needs to read the IP address (to understand in which country the Ad will be served in) and the operating system; 
allow our customers to generate user segments (what we call "audiences") based your previous interactions with their advertising campaigns;
allow our customers to target identifiers based on them being part of certain user segments (those segments may have been created with our platform or a different one);
allow our customers to track whether or not you have engaged with their Ads

Our clients may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that Ads can be better targeted to you. We may also use your Personal Information to detect and prevent fraud.

Allowing our customers to target user segments is what we call "**Interest Based Advertising**".

We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity (we have set a general maximum limit of six (6) months).


## Who has access to your Personal Information?

We do not share any Personal Information obtained by way of the cookie usage of our website. With regards to information obtained through your usage of bsmart, we may share your information with third-party partners used to provide you with add-on services to bsmart if and when you request them.

With regard to device identifiers obtained on behalf of our customers, we may need to share your Personal Information with certain partners at the very moment our system has to decide whether or not to buy some specific ad space as programmed or instructed by our clients. For example, if the App or website where you are about to see an ad does not tell us which country you are in, we will need to send your IP address to one of our partners to find out about the country based on your IP address (all of our campaigns have to be targeted to one or several specific countries). Or, if our customer is working with a Data Provider, and targets a campaign to user segments created by that Data Provider, we will need to check with said Data Provider whether your identifier is in the targeted user segment before we decide to try and buy the Ad slot.

Our customers will have access to your information when they have purchased that impression and thus have served you an Ad.

## Third Party Service Providers we work with:

- AdSquare ([www.adsquare.com](http://www.adsquare.com)), a mobile data exchange who can work as a Data Provider for our customers

However, when we use third party service providers, we disclose only the Personal Information that is necessary to deliver the service and we have arrangements in place that requires them to keep your information secure and not to use it for any other purposes. Please be reassured that we will not release your information to third parties beyond the Ads serving process we’ve described, unless you have requested us to do so, or we are required to do so by law, for example, by a court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime.

  Your iOS or Android mobile device provides a "Limit Ad Tracking" or "Opt out of interest-based advertising" setting.

  When you opt out, you may still see the same number of Ads on your mobile device; however, these ads may be less relevant because they won’t be based on your interests, neither Ads bought with our platform, nor with any other platform. We may continue to serve you Ads based on other non-personal information, such as ads related to the content of the application you are using.

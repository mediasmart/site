Launched in 2012, mediasmart is the first Spanish DSP focusing on
the real time optimization of mobile advertising using its proprietary
technology platform. Mediasmart gives access to global mobile
inventory both in mobile apps and web. A proven, scalable
technology currently handling more than 400,000 ad requests per
second, mediasmart can be used directly by clients on a self-serve
basis or via APIs, and it handles both RTB and programmatic direct
buys. Located in Madrid, London, and Paris, mediasmart Mobile is
backed by well-known investors KOMM Investment and Kibo Ventures.

> Mediasmart Sees 78% Decrease in Mobile Ad Quality Violations Using GeoEdge

###Challenge
Mediasmart places a strong emphasis on the quality of their mobile
advertising inventory (for tablets and smartphones). Providing
customers with a self-serve solution that allows them to upload
their own creatives put the mediasmart guarantee of high ad quality
at risk. In addition, customers wanted to upload their own ad tags
instead of creative assets, increasing the risk as tags are more dicult
to control and regulate. As a result, mediasmart limited the use of
third-party tags to specific, pre-verified customers, but as they
scaled up, they knew they needed to open up this capability.
To preserve the quality of the ads in the mediasmart inventory, their
team had to scan creatives manually, a long process where many
violations often went unnoticed. At the same time, mediasmart was
growing rapidly and receiving a large number of inbound requests
for business. There was a surge in ad quality incidents, most often
with auto-redirects, which upset customers. Mediasmart knew they
needed a solution _ and fast.
The solution they wanted would have an automated method to
scan ad tags, including third-party tags, to detect
non-compliant behavior.
The solution would enable mediasmart
to scale up and open the third-party
ad tag capability without any backlash.

### Solution
After researching all the leading solutions in the market, mediasmart
decided to integrate with GeoEdge, known for ad quality protection
against auto-redirects, malware, oensive content and more on
mobile devices, Apple or Android. In record time, they implemented
GeoEdge’s solution and saw immediate improvement.
Utilizing the GeoEdge mobile ad security and verication solutions,
creatives are checked as soon as they are uploaded or changed.
They are also scanned with high frequency, congurable by specic
account or seat ID.
With mediasmart’s own interface integrated directly with GeoEdge
via APIs, creatives go live only when they have successfully passed
GeoEdge’s ad tag scanner and a visual audit is completed by
mediasmart’s ad quality and approval management teams.
Mediasmart also maintains a list of blacklisted domains. Any creative
that generates a violation with GeoEdge is automatically rejected,
and both the ad quality team and the client are notied.
The rejected creative then automatically stops running in all
campaigns it is linked to. Additionally, any malicious domain
reported by GeoEdge is automatically added to the list of blacklisted
domains. Once a domain is recorded in this list, any campaign that
makes reference to it, whether the source is in the tags, URLs or
pixels, is rejected.

### Result
Using the GeoEdge mobile ad quality management solution has
reduced mediasmart’s ad quality incidents by 78 percent, especially
auto-redirects. Mediasmart detects the violations and removes the
oensive creatives immediately, and they can now invest and serve
up to eight times more impressions before generating an ad policy
violation with an external party.
In addition, the strong level of automation has increased
mediasmart’s eectiveness while saving them time.
Mediasmart is condent using GeoEdge, knowing that the inventory
of their supply partners will be protected. And when challenges
arise from mediasmart customers, the GeoEdge team is quick to
respond and provide their expertise.
Mediasmart has also instituted a policy by which all new customers
receive a set number of scans per hour, any customers found in
violation are required to increase their scan rate and, depending
on the nature of the violation, can be prevented from accessing
certain inventory, if not all.

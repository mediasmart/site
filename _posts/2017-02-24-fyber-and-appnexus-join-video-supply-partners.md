Fyber and AppNexus join video supply partners

London – mediasmart Mobile – a mobile technology company whose DSP (Demand Side Platform) optimizes the media buying process to maximize engagement – has secured a range of new partnerships with leading video specialists, Fyber and omnichannel provider, AppNexus.

With availability of a rapidly growing inventory for this type of programmatic format for mobile devices, the new partners add to a broad range of mediasmart’s existing supply partners, offering both in-stream and out-stream video.

The new partnerships join existing video supply partners including MoPub, Google, ONE by AOL: Mobile, OpenX, and Axonix among others. Together, they will enable mediasmart customers to use video as part of their branding and performance campaigns. Mediasmart’s predictive targeting algorithms also enable its clients to offer a cost-per-viewing (CPV) model to advertisers.

“Our platform has supported video creatives for many years, but it’s only recently that suppliers are widely getting behind the video format,” said Noelia Amoedo, CEO, mediasmart. “With sufficient reach now in place it’s up to advertisers to recognise it as a viable option and make it a default component of their campaigns.”

According to some sources, only 37% of video spending went to mobile devices. Nevertheless, mobile video is expected to be the main growth driver for advertising spending in digital video, with 3-digit annual increases until 2019, according to eMarketer.

“Fyber’s partnerships with strong mobile DSPs such as Mediasmart are important to support mobile video brands and advertisers across all screens and devices. “As mobile is now the most popular consumer ‘first screen’, and with video becoming one of the most compelling formats for brands to engage with their audiences, Fyber has seen dramatic increases in programmatic mobile video spend, said Erwin Plomp, Chief Commercial Officer of Fyber’s RTB division.

“This partnership will enable MediaSmart advertisers to access Fyber’s cross-channel audience on desktop, mobile web and in-app, including Fyber’s SDK direct in-app audience reaching more than 500 million monthly active users globally.”

You may have noticed that we did not communicate when releasing v.1.0.5. so, we now give you one update for v.1.0.5. and v.1.0.6. together. mediasmart console keeps improving week after week and sometimes it is difficult for us to keep up! Today we want to highlight the new Invoicing area, which allows organizations' owners to check invoices and their status.

We also mentioned in our last communication a couple of new video supply partners - Fyber and StickyAds - and said that AppNexus video format was coming. Well, we can say now that AppNexus video is here, and we also have some more good news from them if you read below!

## Invoicing Area

We often got requests from customers asking for invoices that their finance team didn´t get or couldn´t find so, we decided to make invoices readily available. From now on, Owners of an organization can see a new area called "Invoicing" at the bottom of the left menu, where they can check monthly invoices issued for their organization. Each invoice is represented in a box and you can click on the invoice to be directed to the invoice in our invoicing system: a URL where you can download the invoice or pay it. If your finance team doesn´t find a particular email, you can always click on the corresponding invoice in console, and send to them the URL you get directed to.

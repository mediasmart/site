Mediasmart mobile, a mobile technology company whose DSP (Demand Side Platform) optimizes the media buying process to maximize engagement, has just opened a new office in Paris. The new presence in France adds to mediasmart’s existing offices in London and Madrid.

It will focus on providing local support to the many existing customers in the French market and proactively developing the market in France. This will be facilitated through the new hires of Aniss Laamouri as Sales Technology Manager and François Peltiez as Sales & Marketing Manager, who both bring significant mobile advertising experience to the region.

Since its inception in 2012, mediasmart has grown at a triple digit annual rate and its self-serve platform now handles campaigns in more than 60 countries.  
Aniss Laamouri, has ten years of experience in product management and digital services, and holds degrees in Digital Business, IT Management and Computer Science. He has a strong professional background in business development, market research and R&D. He has also worked previously with mobile advertising companies such as InMobi and Smart AdServer in senior sales engineer and programmatic product manager roles respectively.

François Peltiez previously worked as sales manager in France and EMEA for InMobi publicity network for smartphones and tablets, and as a marketer in companies such as Ericsson and Web et Solutions. He holds an International Business, Marketing and Management degree from the Rouen Business School, as well as an MBA degree in Marketing and Online Business from the Institut Léonard Da Vinci Paris.

> “France has been a key market for mediasmart over recent years, and we are looking forward to consolidating our position there with a local office. We aim to reinforce our commitment to the French market and are pleased to rely on the experience and local knowledge of Aniss and François”, comments Noelia Amoedo, CEO of mediasmart.

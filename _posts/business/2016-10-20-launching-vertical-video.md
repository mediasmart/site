We have released our latest version of console (v1.0.4) and we want to highlight a cool new feature that comes with it, especially interesting if you are running video campaigns: the possibility to add vertical - also called portrait - videos. Read below for details and, as always, please do not hesitate to contact your Account Manager!

## Vertical videos
You can now upload your videos in both landscape and portrait versions, so that your viewers automatically get one or the other depending on the device's orientation at any given moment. You can also upload a vertical video only, or a horizontal video only, to exclusively reach users with this format. Vertical videos are served out-stream, either in an interstitial or a "reveal" type of format, for example.

Take into account that if you want to use end-cards, you will need two different creatives: one for the vertical version and another one for the horizontal one.

Have into account that whether a specific format or not is supported shall depend on each SSP. You can see more information about our video offering and what different SSPs support in [this presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1DHoyKqFNECeWxNMlFCbzZXSGs/view). We have just added connections to a couple of new video SSPs - Fyber and Sticky Ads - and video in AppNexus is coming soon as well.

Finally, you can find here the functional specs for the video files to upload.

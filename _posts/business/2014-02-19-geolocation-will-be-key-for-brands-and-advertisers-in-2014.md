mediasmart successfully runs geolocation-based campaigns for multiple clients such as Movistar in Spain and Maison de Bonneterie in the Netherlands

The company, specialized in mobile advertising, has measured user interaction rates up to three times superior on geolocation-based campaigns, compared to those that are not

Since its introduction to the advertising industry, geolocation has been quite a buzzword, perceived as one of the main advantages of mobile devices compared to PCs for advertisers. However, accurate geolocation has not been a useful tool for advertisers and brands in mobile display until recently. The biggest challenge has been that the reachable user base was very small, because accurate geolocation, unlike IP based geolocation, requires specific user&#8217;s approval.

This has started to change. Nowadays more users are willing to share their location with a simple click, as many mobile applications require it in order to meet their purpose. Within those apps users can naturally receive advertising campaigns that take into consideration their location. Thanks to the huge RTB (real time bidding) inventory and to companies such as mediasmart, it&#8217;s now possible to launch geolocation-based campaigns with a big enough reach and great advertising effectiveness.

mediasmart has developed campaigns that make extensive use of geolocation for clients such as Movistar in Spain and the shopping centers Maison de Bonneterie. In the Netherlands. As the company also optimizes the media buying process based on post-click events, advertisers are able to maximize results on their own physical stores by using coupons or similar devices. mediasmart has seen interaction rates up to three times higher in this type of campaigns.

Noelia Amoedo, mediasmart&#8216;s CEO, says: &#8220;thanks to geolocation strategies, we can help clients connect with their public in the physical world, which is one step further in our mission to make mobile advertising as effective as possible.&#8221;

### Why geolocation?
Using geolocation on a mobile advertising campaign may or may not make sense depending on the goals of the campaign. These are some examples of how geolocation can be used effectively:

  - **Drive traffic to physical locations**: One of the advantages of geolocation is that advertisers with a physical presence can limit their campaign to the geographic area close to their points of sale, with the goal to drive traffic to their stores. Let&#8217;s imagine an advertiser has a certain special offer in its stores. mediasmart can impact only users located within a few hundred meters of the stores, and, if the user clicks on the banner, it will open up a map with directions to the closest store and a discount coupon that can be redeemed in the store.

  - **Customize the message according to the location**: It is possible to adapt the advertising campaign to the user&#8217;s location in order to maximize the conversion rate. For example, if a user is physically close to the advertiser&#8217;s point of sale, (s)he will be shown an in-store offer and directions to the store. If the user isn&#8217;t close to the store, (s)he will be shown a generic offer linking to the web, the mobile app or a call center.

  - **Reaching your audience in a specific physical place**: It is possible to use geolocated campaigns to reach an audience whose interests are related to the service or product that is being promoted. Imagine, for example, how advertisers in the travel industry may want to run campaigns around airports or train stations.

London, XX October 2016 – Mediasmart - a provider of self-serve mobile first programmatic technology that maximises mobile audience engagement -  has made a senior appointment to lead its continued growth in the UK ad-tech sector.

Mo Hussain joins Mediasmart’s Commercial Team as UK Commercial Director to lead the UK sales and marketing function. He will also analyse market needs and drive Mediasmart’s UK strategy and roadmap.

Mo arrives from ad-tech company Affectv where he was a Business Director leading the UK sales team. Having joined the company at its early stages he helped them grow year on year winning various awards along the way. He brings over ten years of experience in digital advertising across planning and buying, native, ad-tech, video and programmatic.
“Mo will be instrumental in helping us execute our UK market strategy,” said Noelia Amoedo, CEO of Mediasmart. “As one of the first demand side platforms in the mobile space, and one of the remaining few with proprietary technology, we are focused on empowering other companies on the demand side of the ecosystem. Mo will help convey how our console and APIs will bring value to any media buyer with the ultimate goal of enabling advertisers to reach mobile audiences as effectively as possible"

Mo also holds strong start up and consultancy experience. He currently consults for educational start up, The Future London Academy, guiding them commercially through his extensive digital experience.
Established in January 2012, Mediasmart manages over 400.000 ad requests per second.     The company has rapidly scaled internationally thanks to its self-serve model. With its home based Spanish activity representing less than 4% of the revenue in 2016, it has sustained tripe digit growth rates without a significant investment in additional resources.

 “I am excited to be joining Mediasmart and using my experience to help drive its further success in the UK, whilst helping its clients take advantage of new mobile media buying capabilities.” said Mr. Hussain.

Mediasmart has offices in Spain and the UK with the imminent addition of France by the end of this year. It serves international clients, largely in EMEA and The Americas, who manage global campaigns. So far this year it has run campaigns in over 60 countries.

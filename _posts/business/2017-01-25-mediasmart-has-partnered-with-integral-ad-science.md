Independently of whether they use mediasmart’s console or the API, mediasmart customers can now optimise and analyse their mobile ad campaigns using IAS’ solutions for pre-bid targeting – using verification features from IAS including viewability, fraud, brand safety and ad quality, when serving ads through mediasmart’s platform.

With third-party verification becoming increasingly vital to ensuring ad transparency; buyers, brands and agencies can now leverage the efficiency of programmatic with the added assurance that their messages are being seen by relevant audiences.

> “With increasing numbers of advertisers using programmatic methods for mobile branding campaigns, their confidence in their campaigns actually being seen – and seen in the right place – is critical, ”said Noelia Amoedo, mediasmart Mobile´s CEO. “As part of our mission to make mobile media buying effective, Integral Ad Science was a clear partner choice given their leading position in the mobile ecosystem. This is especially important where apps are concerned, given they are so different technologically from the desktop ecosystem.”

> “At IAS, we are committed to improving the advertising ecosystem, across display, video and mobile. Our technology and data provides sellers and buyers with peace of mind that their ads will have the opportunity to influence consumers, and in turn, generate real value,” commented Lee Moulding, Business Development Director at Integral Ad Science.

Having grown rapidly in terms of reach and geography over the past four years, mediasmart now manages over 600.000 ad requests per second and runs campaingns in over 60 countries through its self serve model.

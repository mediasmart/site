Today we want to introduce you to our new Public Deals, which you will be able to discover within your account and select to use in your campaigns. Find below more information on how to use this new feature. In case of further questions, please do not hesitate to contact your Account Manager!

## Public Deals
We know the discovery of available deals from SSPs is a challenge and, while we work with the industry on automating the discovery process, we´ve taken a little step forward with a new feature. From version 1.0.3 onwards you can find Deals that you did not set up, but we are making available for you to use in your campaigns if you consider them interesting. We call these Public Deals and they can be distinguished from the others thanks to the "Public" label placed in each card.

If you click within a particular Public Deal you will see a description of the deal (price, segmentation, etc..) and you will have the option of making it "Available in Campaigns". By marking this checkbox, the Deal will become automatically available in the Deals list field from the Deals and Pricing section of your Campaign.

If you go to the Deals section today you will find some Public Deals available, for example, several from Nexage. You can use Deals to reach certain types of publishers or even certain audiences, and you can always check how many bid requests have come in for a particular deal during the current day at the top left of the deal box.

And of course, you can always search at the top right of your screen to find available deals.

We´ll continue to extend our list of Public Deals and, as always, if you have any feedback of deals that would be interesting to you don´t hesitate to contact your account manager or support@mediasmart.io.

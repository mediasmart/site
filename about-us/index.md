Back in January 2012 the world of mobile advertising was still dominated by traditional ad networks selling impressions and clicks and optimizing campaigns to maximize CTRs. The first mobile ad exchanges were getting started, enabling mobile optimized inventory to be bought programmatically using real time bidding. That is when mediasmart was founded, embracing real time bidding as the most effective media buying paradigm. The company has since then evolved to support private deals as well, additional formats beyond display and integrations with multiple third parties in the ecosystem, but always staying true to its mission: allowing advertisers to effectively reach mobile audiences in real time, while maximizing engagement with campaigns.

Since its inception, mediasmart has always been very clear on its position in the mobile advertising ecosystem: full focus on advertisers and the buying process.
